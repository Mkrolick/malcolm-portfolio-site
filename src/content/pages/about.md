## Malcolm Krolick - Lifelong learner, based on the web

**Greetings!** Hey, I'm Malcolm. I want to build beautiful things. 

## Skills and Expertise

I mostly work in software land; building out products to help empower people. But, I'm trying to break more into hardware. I've worn a lot of hats from building out projects, working on research, running decoding at JHU Brain Computer Interface Society, working at MIT LL teaching cyber operations, or working on YouTube's Ecommerce Ops Team.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I want to build cool stuff, simply for the sake that in one life there's a fixed amount of time that can be spent. This philosphy ripples into my life painting my ambitions and my effort at each moment.

## Continuous Learning

Technology pushes the frontier of knowledge. It's vital to stay on top of tech because it expands the horizons for what can be seen and built.

## Get in Touch

If you want to chat or want some help or are doing some cool stuff. Please reach out, it's inspiring to see other people dreaming about future and I want to be a part of it. 

_Let's build something amazing together!_
